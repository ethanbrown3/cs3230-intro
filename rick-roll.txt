hello world 

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand
[Chorus]
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
